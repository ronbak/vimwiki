== First steps ==
    * register nickname
    `/nickname foo`
    `/msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com`
    * identify your nickname

        # First, we need to enable smart filters:
        `/set irc.look.smart_filter "on"`
        # Next, we will create the sfilter alias:
        `/alias sfilter filter add irc_smart_$server_$channel irc.$server.$channel irc_smart_filter *`
        # We can now type
        `/sfilter`
         in any buffer, and the smart filter will only be enabled for that buffer.
        # The following alias will remove a previously enabled smart filter in the current buffer. Add the alias:
        `/alias rmsfilter filter del irc_smart_$server_$channel`
        and execute it by
        `/rmsfilter`
